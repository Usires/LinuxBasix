# LinuxBasix (Rust version)
Personalised installation tool after basic distro install (based on apt/flatpak).

+ Made for Linux distros based on APT as a package manager (i.e. Debian, Ubuntu, Pop_OS! etc.)
+ Written in C++ with `ncurses` library for easy menu navigation
+ Based on coding examples in the NCURSES Howto by Pradeep Padala, v1.9 from 2005
+ Rust conversion based on C++ version, conversion with support of Claude 3.5 by Anthropic
+ Uses `wget` to download fonts as ZIP archives and unzips them to `~/.local/share/fonts`
+ Runs `fc-cache` after font installation
